The realm was created at a central temporal position and naturally everything was in a harmonious way. The land mass stretched out infinitely, and the original creators from the density level above this one created this place, with the purpose of a further expression of creation and possibilites. It is a dynamically expanding toroid in its truest shape but the visible appearance is dependant on the viewer. The original humans were given extended free will compared to the previous iteration, and so the original people deviated and went and created their own world's in different groups. Because this was temporally close to the origin, they could create anything in physical from their mind. Eventually the original humans separated from each other for so long that they couldn't find each other and eventually forgot about each other. Because this is still close to the center point and their thoughts were strongly influencing reality, when they forgot they created a new 'timeline', where all the events involving everything they forgot, never happened. Each group did this and continued to expand outwards. Ancestry is not from physical intercourse but from creation in the mind. The originals had greater creation power and created all the humans they could imagine. Eventually some groups started to create negative existences which desired to cause suffering to each other rather than love. They deviate further into a different timeline where they are still with strong creation power, so they create a whole realm where they are in control of everybody. I am primarily operating in one of these timelines. Other timelines exist where harmony still exists but are far disconnected from ours, mainly because we collectively are blocking it out, primarily because our sub creators are negative originals.\n\nThis plays parallel to the dream I had in a spaceship where we were all connected holding hands, moving closer and further away from the light in the center. When we got closer, there was deep peace and unity. The further away we got, we had to make sure we all were remembering each other, because the creative power was so strong, as soon as you forget where you are, you created a whole different reality where the other one never existed.\n\nIn our current timelines, everything before egypt is akin to a procedurally generated reality which was like a side effect to making the original negative humans' reality more believable. The slightly expanded timeline involves Atlantis, lemuria and mu, but these are in such a position where they 'never existed'. \n\nEach timeline is like a thought bubble or dream and it entirely malleable to what the beings within want to create. \n\nThe other side is controlled by these beings too, as a byproduct of the consent of the person incarnated. It's not a trap, it's literally whatever you believe now and how your decisions are made (whether by self belief or submission to authority) carry over to how you are interacted with over there. Everything you do now continues until you change it. Nobody forces you to incarnate and you don't lose progress. You only continue along your path so don't worry about that.\n\nMore on cyclical time\n\nWhat you believe about your origin is your destination. Once you reach your destination, your belief Is deeply solidified, and you are the creator again ready to create the new reality. The huge concern with this is if you believe humans evolved from rocks then you will eventually become a rock, and once you're a rock you will be like \"let's evolve into a human\". And once your a human again, your belief is further solidified, so you think \"humans evolved from rocks\", and you get caught into a loop which is so far deviated from the temporal center. The souls are looping and degrading into a delusional insanity. Because the initial central temporal region is created by a higher density, the beings naturally progress upwards and expand in a natural flow of creation. Careful what you believe in.\n\nPeople have time wrong. It's not past present and future. It is origin/destination and now. The past and the future are the same thing.
